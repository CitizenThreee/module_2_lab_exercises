            <p id="profile-text">
                Hello there! My name is Aedan. Originally from New Zealand, I grew up for part of my childhood around the globe 
                in Bolivia. There I learned Spanish as a second language at a young age, which I believe helped me later in life 
                to pick up more languages, such as C#, Javascript, and HTML. I also gained great perspective on the wider world. 
                I love learning new things and have gotten pretty good at it. I have been coding for around 8 years and am passionate 
                about software, and building solutions for real-world problems.

                This is an intensive course covering the full range of skills a software engineer would need, including HTML, CSS, 
                JavaScript, Version Control, Industry Best Practices, Test Driven Development, React, Databases, API Development, and 
                Software Deployment. The Course ends with a capstone project covering all the aspects of web development. While I am 
                familiar with a lot of what is covered in the course, it will serve to fill in any gaps I may have and give me best 
                practices to take with me into the industry.

                        such as 3d Printing, visualization, etc. This has helped me grasp the importance of 
                        understanding project requirements, asking questions, and communicating clearly to 
                        deliver a design that the customer is happy with. My diligence and clarity while working

                        hardware. I created batch scripts to launch EC2 instances and the required 
                        server-side clients to improve the user experience when connecting the VR headsets 
                        to the server.

                        C# to create character controllers, change the environment based on user input, and 
                        handle other actions.

            <p>
                In 2023 I created an app for iOS and Android, using React Native, Expo, and SQLite. 
                The app is a helpful cooking / food app, with functionalities that allow the user to: 
                create and view recipes with handy ingredients tabs, search their recipes using names 
                and tags, create a cooking calendar, write shopping lists by adding items from recipes, 
                your cooking calendar, or single items, and import/export recipes to share with others. 
                Building the app gave me a good understanding of the full process of building software, 
                from front end design, to databases, debugging, and much more. You can find it on iOS and 
                Android:
